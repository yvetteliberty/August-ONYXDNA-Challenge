## Tools Used
- PowerBI
- DAX functions
- Charts
  
 ## Area of Knowledge
 - Cleaning and Transformation
 - Dax calculation  ( Average , YTD,Retention, Churn rate )
 - Story telling
 - Business insight and  interpretation

## My Approach:
 This analysis, I focused on four key areas:
 - Membership – understanding member segments, churn patterns, and upgrade behaviour
-  Revenue – identifying drivers of ARPU and lifetime value
- Engagement – analysing class participation and personal training usage
 - Location Performance
   This framework provides a holistic view of member behaviour and business performance, helping fitness centres like MyGym make smarter, data-driven decisions.
